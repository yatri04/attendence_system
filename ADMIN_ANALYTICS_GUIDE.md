- For HODs: Change department assignment
- For Principals: Department field is not applicable

### Security Considerations
- **Strong Passwords**: Use complex passwords for HOD and Principal accounts
- **Email Verification**: Ensure email addresses are valid and accessible
- **Department Assignment**: Only assign HODs to departments they should manage
- **Regular Audits**: Periodically review account access and permissions

## Dashboard Access URLs

### HOD Dashboard
- **URL**: `/hod`
- **Access**: HOD role only
- **Features**: Department-specific analytics

### Principal Dashboard
- **URL**: `/principal`
- **Access**: Principal role only
- **Features**: Institution-wide analytics

## Best Practices

### For HOD Accounts
1. **One HOD per Department**: Assign only one HOD per department
2. **Department Alignment**: Ensure HOD is assigned to the correct department
3. **Regular Access**: HODs should have consistent access to monitor their department

### For Principal Accounts
1. **Limited Principals**: Typically only one Principal account needed
2. **Institution-wide Access**: Principal can see all departments
3. **Strategic Overview**: Principal dashboard for high-level decision making

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"No department assigned to HOD"**: Ensure HOD is assigned to a department
2. **Access Denied**: Check if user has correct role permissions
3. **Missing Data**: Ensure classes and students exist before viewing analytics

### Support
- Check user roles in the database
- Verify department assignments for HODs
- Ensure proper authentication and authorization

## Example Workflow

### Setting Up Analytics for a New Institution
1. **Create Departments**: Set up academic departments
2. **Create HOD Accounts**: One HOD per department
3. **Create Principal Account**: One Principal for institution overview
4. **Assign Classes**: Ensure classes are properly assigned to departments
5. **Add Students**: Import students into appropriate classes
6. **Test Access**: Verify HOD and Principal can access their dashboards

This setup provides comprehensive analytics access for institutional leadership to monitor attendance and academic performance.
