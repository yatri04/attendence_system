## üì∂ WiFi-Based Attendance Verification

### Overview
The system now includes comprehensive WiFi-based attendance verification to ensure students are physically present on campus when marking attendance. This prevents remote attendance marking and enhances the integrity of the attendance system.

### Key Features

#### For Teachers:
- **WiFi Network Configuration**: Add and manage campus WiFi networks by router IP
- **Subnet Management**: Configure specific subnet masks for precise network control
- **Network Testing**: Test current connection against configured networks
- **Multiple Networks**: Support for multiple WiFi networks (different buildings/areas)
- **Network Status**: Activate/deactivate networks as needed

#### For Students:
- **Real-time Status**: Live display of WiFi connection status
- **Automatic Verification**: System automatically checks WiFi connection during attendance
- **Clear Feedback**: Visual indicators showing connection status
- **Periodic Checks**: WiFi status updates every 30 seconds

### Technical Implementation

#### WiFi Network Model
```python
class WiFiNetwork(db.Model):
    name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)  # Network name
    router_ip = db.Column(db.String(45), nullable=False)  # Router IP
    subnet_mask = db.Column(db.String(45), nullable=True)  # Subnet mask
    is_active = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=True)  # Active status
    created_by = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey("users.id"))  # Creator
```

#### Verification Process
1. **IP Detection**: System detects student's current IP address
2. **Network Matching**: Checks if IP is within configured WiFi networks
3. **Subnet Validation**: Validates against specific subnet masks
4. **Fallback Check**: Falls back to general private network check if no WiFi configured
5. **Attendance Recording**: Records attendance with WiFi network information

#### Configuration Examples
- **Campus WiFi**: Router IP `192.168.1.1` with `/24` subnet
- **Lab Network**: Router IP `192.168.2.1` with `/24` subnet  
- **Library WiFi**: Router IP `10.0.1.1` with `/24` subnet

### Usage Instructions

#### Setting Up WiFi Networks (Teachers)
1. Login as a teacher
2. Go to "WiFi Network Management" from dashboard
3. Click "Add WiFi Network"
4. Enter network name and router IP
5. Optionally specify subnet mask (defaults to /24)
6. Save and activate the network

#### Testing WiFi Connection
1. Use "Test Connection" button on teacher dashboard
2. System will show current IP and matched network
3. Verify connection before generating QR codes

#### Student Experience
1. Connect to campus WiFi
2. Login to student dashboard
3. Check WiFi status indicator (green = connected, red = not connected)
4. Scan QR code to mark attendance
5. System verifies WiFi connection automatically
